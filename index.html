     <ol>
        <li>Open up the webpage you want to view in chrome. For an example we will open <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic</a></li>
        <li>Click the view tab which is located in the bar at the top of your computer next to "edit and "selection".</li>
        <li>Under view, ther should be a list. Click developer which islocated at the bottom of this list. It shoudl open up another list.</li>
        <li>Click "View Source" which should be the first element in this list. This should reload the page youre on and show the HTML source code.</li>
        <li>A shortcut for this is do click the keys "alt", "command" and "U" simultaneously. </li>
        <li> To get rid of the source code, delete the text "view-source:" from the URL at the top of chrome and reload the page.</li>
